Dependency Injection:
Transient
Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.
Scoped
Scoped lifetime services are created once per request.
Singleton
Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they're requested (or when ConfigureServices is run if you specify an instance there) 
and then every subsequent request will use the same instance.
